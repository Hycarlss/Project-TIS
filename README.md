Some file uploaded on 2023 and some file uploaded on 20/1/2024 because of GITHUB account have been banned between December 2023 and early January 2024 .
I try to reset my password but GITHUB didnt give me any access to do it so but at early 2024 i try to reset again and i got an access to reset my password back .
Its happen because I used cracked apps that stole my gmail and password that allow someone to access my account , and i got banned because of suspicious activity .
I sincerely apologize for late submission .

| 1 | The experience with the design thinking prototype has been very beneficial to my learning process. It made the exploration of technology's convergence easier by allowing software and hardware to be seamlessly integrated. By using my knowledge in a practical way, I was able to address real user needs and problems and provide solutions that were impactful and precise. Beyond the technical aspects, the collaborative process helped me become a much better team player by teaching me how to have productive conversations and collaborate with my teammates to find creative solutions.
