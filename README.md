*Our Project*

The HealHub apps are digital resources with a range of functions that promote mental health, including behaviour control, education, mindfulness training, mood monitoring, access to therapy, and community support. They are not a replacement for expert assistance, but they do provide self-help resources, accessibility, and convenience. Selecting trustworthy apps is important, and keep in mind that getting advice from a mental health professional is essential, particularly for severe or persistent mental health issues.

| 1 | The experience with the design thinking prototype has been very beneficial to my learning process. It made the exploration of technology's convergence easier by allowing software and hardware to be seamlessly integrated. By using my knowledge in a practical way, I was able to address real user needs and problems and provide solutions that were impactful and precise. Beyond the technical aspects, the collaborative process helped me become a much better team player by teaching me how to have productive conversations and collaborate with my teammates to find creative solutions.
